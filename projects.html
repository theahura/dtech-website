                <br>
                At the end of the day, we are all here because we love to program. Whether it is complex, multi-tiered professional projects or small scripts to automate life, it has a place at Diagraphic. We encourage our developers to code and build whatever interests them - whether it is game development or social media. Below, you can find some passion projects and works-in-progress that our developers are working on in their spare time.

                        <h1>Mumblr</h1>
                        Mumblr is an orator's best friend - or worst nightmare. An app designed to teach public speaking, Mumblr uses a combination of natural language processing, Google Speech API voice recognition, and classical conditioning to teach individuals to stop relying on their crutch words while they speak. The app takes in user voice commands, checks against thousands of n-grams to give context to words, and then decides if the words are used correctly. If not, Mumblr will yell at the user - once per mistake. User's have the option to customize which words the app is looking for, to tailor it to their needs.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Mumblr was the winner of "Best Use of a Google API" at Hack Rutgers Spring 2015. Though it is unlikely to continue being updated, it is currently up and linked above. Mumblr works best with a strong microphone and a fast internet connection (for the voice analysis, which is done over Google servers). Not all features currently online.

                        <h1>Defend the Lounge</h1>
                            Defend the Lounge is a top-down 2d gratuitous violence simulator. Players navigate through a retro-inspired pixel art rendering of a dorm lounge  at Columbia in an attempt to fight an ever-increasing army of Ganesh clones. When players come in contact with a Ganesh, they lose health. But if they manage to slay all of the villains in the round, they advance on to the next. After each successful bout, the game displays the scoreboard along with a random gif tagged "victory", thanks to the Giphy API.

                        </br>
                            Defend the Lounge allows users to see their ultimate high scores. The game also features food powerups in the form of chicken tenders to restore health. How long will you be able to survive the scourge?

                        <h1> Rumblr </h1>
                            It originated from a discussion between friends. A bunch of freshmen, glued to their cell phones, their Smash 4 competitions on Wii, and their friendly swordfights in the hallway. This camaraderie, combined with a fierce competitive edge, could only lead to one thing:
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            "What about Tinder, but for fighting?"
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            Rumblr is a Google-integrated social competition service. Mature users age 18 and up simply connect their Google accounts to experience competition on a whole new level. Presently, the service allows users to connect with those in their immediate area, and then flip, Tinder-style, through profiles of those around them, and decide to Rumble them in the competition of their choice. Eventually, challengers will be able to define tags for types of Rumbles, which could be anything from video games to fistfights.

                            This is currently a work in progress. Follow along at rumblr.diagraphictech.com.

                        <h1> Periodic Table </h1>
                        Understanding energy models of various elements can be extremely difficult - not only are there multiple types per element, but each one follows its own patterns and rules. The result? Confusion. 
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        As a good way to learn how energy models work - and as a way to create a study tool for future students - we developed a basic html webpage/webapp that compiles all of the information on energy models in a single, easy to access area. Comparing models and understanding what role they play in an element's properties just became infinitely easier.

                        <h1> Cumulus </h1>
                        Cumulus is the cloud storage aggregator.  It allows users to store their files across various cloud storage services.  The main drive for this project was the simple interface: "one file in, one file out", no fiddling between cloud storage services and looking for a file. 
                        </br>
                         </br>
                        But that is the boring half. Cumulus does more than combine clouds, it actively looks for new storage space by using data storage in creative and hacky ways using the idea that all data is just bits. Images will get stored to soundcloud, videos and documents will be stored to Flickr, and .exes will be split and stored as file names or even youtube videos.
                        </br>
                         </br>
                        Finally, Cumulus adds an innate layer of security due to its file storage protocol.  Any file you store is broken up into blocks which are distributed across all services with which Cumulus is connected.  Even if one service were to be breached, no useful data could be gained from the files that are stored there.  Cumulus aims to combine the capacity of cloud storage services and provide an easy, secure mechanism with which users can store their files.
