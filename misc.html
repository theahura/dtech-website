                 <h5> We Code </h5>

                At the end of the day, we are all here because we love to program. Whether it is complex, multi-tiered professional projects or small scripts to automate life, it has a place at Diagraphic. We encourage our developers to code and build whatever interests them - whether it is game development or social media. Below, you can find some passion projects and works-in-progress that our developers are working on in their spare time.

                            Mumblr is an orator's best friend - or worst nightmare. An app designed to teach public speaking, Mumblr uses a combination of natural language processing, Google Speech API voice recognition, and classical conditioning to teach individuals to stop relying on their crutch words while they speak. The app takes in user voice commands, checks against thousands of n-grams to give context to words, and then decides if the words are used correctly. If not, Mumblr will yell at the user - once per mistake. User's have the option to customize which words the app is looking for, to tailor it to their needs. 
                        </br>
                        </br>
                            Mumblr was the winner of "Best Use of a Google API" at Hack Rutgers Spring 2015. Though it is unlikely to continue being updated, it is currently up and linked above. Mumblr works best with a strong microphone and a fast internet connection (for the voice analysis, which is done over Google servers). Not all features currently online.

                            Defend the Lounge is a top-down 2d gratuitous violence simulator. Players navigate through a retro-inspired pixel art rendering of a dorm lounge  at Columbia in an attempt to fight an ever-increasing army of Ganesh clones. When players come in contact with a Ganesh, they lose health. But if they manage to slay all of the villains in the round, they advance on to the next. After each successful bout, the game displays the scoreboard along with a random gif tagged "victory", thanks to the Giphy API.

                            Defend the Lounge allows users to see their ultimate high scores. The game also features food powerups in the form of chicken tenders to restore health. How long will you be able to survive the scourge?

                                It originated from a discussion between friends. A bunch of freshmen, glued to their cell phones, their Smash 4 competitions on Wii, and their friendly swordfights in the hallway. This camaraderie, combined with a fierce competitive edge, could only lead to one thing:
                            </br>
                            </br>
                                "What about Tinder, but for fighting?"
                            </br>
                            </br>
                                Rumblr is a Google-integrated social competition service. Mature users age 18 and up simply connect their Google accounts to experience competition on a whole new level. Presently, the service allows users to connect with those in their immediate area, and then flip, Tinder-style, through profiles of those around them, and decide to Rumble them in the competition of their choice. Eventually, challengers will be able to define tags for types of Rumbles, which could be anything from video games to fistfights.

                            Understanding energy models of various elements can be extremely difficult - not only are there multiple types per element, but each one follows its own patterns and rules. The result? Confusion. 
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            As a good way to learn how energy models work - and as a way to create a study tool for future students - we developed a basic html webpage/webapp that compiles all of the information on energy models in a single, easy to access area. Comparing models and understanding what role they play in an element's properties just became infinitely easier.

                            Know thyself; or at least know what your friends know about thyself.  ReRep (Real Rep, Real Reputation) is a project that aims to make clear the connections between us.  On the surface, ReRep is a vanity app, designed so that your friends can verify (or deny) conceptions you have about yourself.  Your friends will also vote on tags that are pulled from the app database which the app thinks are related to you.  In this way, the app crowdsources it's machine learning and eventually builds intricate maps of connections between tags.  See what tags are associated with you on your profile page and see how tags are connected with other tags on the tag map.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            To access your account on ReRep, you log in through Facebook.  This is only so that we can verify you and your friends so they can endorse your tags.  No other information from facebook is actually stored.  In fact, all interaction on ReRep is anonymous.  Only you can see your complete tag diagram, and no one can see if a tag is directly connected with you unless they vote on your profile.  The ultimate of ReRep is the tag map that reveals how tags are connected with each other.
