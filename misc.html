                            Defend the Lounge is a top-down 2d gratuitous violence simulator. Players navigate through a retro-inspired pixel art rendering of a dorm lounge  at Columbia in an attempt to fight an ever-increasing army of Ganesh clones. When players come in contact with a Ganesh, they lose health. But if they manage to slay all of the villains in the round, they advance on to the next. After each successful bout, the game displays the scoreboard along with a random gif tagged "victory", thanks to the Giphy API.

                            Defend the Lounge allows users to see their ultimate high scores. The game also features food powerups in the form of chicken tenders to restore health. How long will you be able to survive the scourge?

                                It originated from a discussion between friends. A bunch of freshmen, glued to their cell phones, their Smash 4 competitions on Wii, and their friendly swordfights in the hallway. This camaraderie, combined with a fierce competitive edge, could only lead to one thing:
                            </br>
                            </br>

                                "What about Tinder, but for fighting?"
                            </br>
                            </br>
                                Rumblr is a Google-integrated social competition service. Mature users age 18 and up simply connect their Google accounts to experience competition on a whole new level. Presently, the service allows users to connect with those in their immediate area, and then flip, Tinder-style, through profiles of those around them, and decide to Rumble them in the competition of their choice. Eventually, challengers will be able to define tags for types of Rumbles, which could be anything from video games to fistfights.
